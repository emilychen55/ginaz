IAR projects may NOT work because of file paths.

Solution:

  1. Re-add all the files .c and .h files that are in the project.

  2. Reconfigure the linker with the correct file path to ti_51ew_cc2540b.xcl.
  It should be in a directory like common/cc2540, but do a recursive search for
  file name to make sure.
